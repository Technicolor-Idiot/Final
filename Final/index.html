<p>Graffiti was once seen as a nuisance and an eyesore has now become one of the most flourishing and revered art forms of the last
   half-century. New York City has long been considered one of the meccas of graffiti and was the canvas of many artists that went on to
   become titans in the world of street art, such as Kenny Scharf, Keith Haring, Lady Pink and Futura.

</p>

<p>However, even though the social status of graffiti has risen since it began in the 1970s,
  it is still illegal, with severity in punishment ranging from hundreds of dollars in fines to jail time.

  <a href="https://edc.nyc/program/graffiti-free-nyc">The Grafitti-Free NYC program</a> was created to report incidents of vandalism by either calling
  311 or submitting a claim online. However, due to the impact of COVID-19 on New York City’s economy, resources were diverted
  and the program has been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-businesses-fret-as-graffiti-removal-program-is-axed-11595178000?cx_testId=3&cx_testVariant=cx_2&cx_artPos=3&mod=WTRN#cxrecs_s"> suspended for an indefinite amount of time.</a>
</p>

<section>
  <p>
The program has since stopped documenting incidents, but from the start of 2019 until the final entry in May of 2020,
 there were over 22,000 reports, more than triple the prior year. Brooklyn claimed more than half of the reported incidents
  making it the borough with the most graffiti art per-square mile.

  “It just has to do with the fact that you have more artists living here than any other place in the country, said Gabriel Shoenberg
  who runs <a href="https://grafftours.com/"> Graff Tours </a>, a tour service that showcases the street art of Brooklyn. “So you just have this amazing, atmosphere and
  camaraderie. You know, networking that you can do that just brings forth more and more art.”

  <p>
As of today, the current number of new graffiti tags is unknown, but the pandemic and proceeding lockdowns <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/nyregion/graffiti-nyc.html">have spurred
on a new dynasty of street artists.</a>
</p>

<p>
  “It's inspiring to see what other people are doing and what you can do compared to them,” said Schoenberg.
   “And you have this unique opportunity to collaborate with them either on purpose or kind of tangentially when they're
   next to you on the street. So it's an amazing opportunity and it's only going to get bigger as the art keeps progressing.”
